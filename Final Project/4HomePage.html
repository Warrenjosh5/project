     A self-reflection completing this project. Think about your challenges and triumphs and any other thoughts about the project.
     Any observations or lessons learned by testing on multiple browsers and devices.

<p> I always wanted to know how the web works today. 
     Reflecting back on this project and the web standadrds course I can say that everything I learned was used to create my final project. 
   Throughout this course I've learned about the building block of websites using hyper-text markup language, cascading styling sheets, and
    javiscript coding. 

</p>
<p>
     This project was a little overwhelming. I would say the past labs played a big role in helping me form my final project 
     as well as mapping out my project on paper before writing any code helped me come up with a plan.
     A challenge I experienced in this cours was undertanding all of the ways javascript incorporates interactivity. 
     It took some time to learn the basics and there is still alot to learn, but I can say that 
     I gained a better understanding on the basics of html, CSS,
      and javascript.
</p>

<p>Overall, this project grew my understanding of the importance of web standards. Beyond the aspects of coding and markup languages, 
     I realized that building accessible, responsive, and usable webpages are essential in creating the best user experince.
      The course as a whole taught me how important it is to create neat and organized html and how standards ensure compatibility across browsers 
      and devices. I also leanrd the value of testing html and coding to fix human mistakes before they impact the end user.</p>
